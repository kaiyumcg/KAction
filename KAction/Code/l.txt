Visibility and Toggle:
	Show or Hide renderers
	SetActive GameObjects
	Enable or Disable gameplay components and actor component

Internal Getter and Components
	Destroy Actors(consider time travel and object pooling)
	Clone Actors(consider time travel and object pooling)
	Parent/ReParent child actor

Mini Actor Set like mass framework/DOTS/Compute Shader:

Execution:
	Easily educatable execution workflow to change execution order of actors and components.
	Custom time dilation
	Pause and Resume
	Can disable tick if not needed

Life and Death:
	Health
	Damage(Fixed/Directional etc)
	Death Async and Respawn Async

List Extension for optimized ref equal and other commonly used methods:

Data layer:
	Not like UE4's one. This is a dictionary where key is string and value is a plain class object instance 
	or certain allowed structs. This is essentially playerpref but runtime one which 
	rests only in memory and not in device storage. 
	A bunch events corresponding to that when the data changes.

Level Prep upon build/play mode--this make sure no null list(actor, components, child actors etc)
							   --proper child/components etc

Update ActorLevelModule's dictionary maps and other data w.r.t. add actor components/remove actor component/child-parent relation change of actor-child actor/
